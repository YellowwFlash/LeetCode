✅ Given Question:
Find the missing and repeating number from an array that should contain numbers from 1 to n.

✅ Given Data:
An array of integers int[] numbers of size n, where one number is missing and one number is repeating. All other numbers from 1 to n are present exactly once.

✅ Intuition:
Since the array should contain all numbers from 1 to n, any deviation in the sum or pattern can help identify the missing and repeated elements. There are three classic approaches:

    1) Sort the array and look for adjacent duplicates.
    2) Use a HashMap to count occurrences.
    3) Use mathematical formulas for sum and square-sum of first n numbers.

-----------------------------------
Approach 1: Using Sorting
-----------------------------------
    - Sort the array to bring duplicate values next to each other.
    - Traverse through the sorted array and compare adjacent elements to find the repeating number.
    - Calculate the sum of all elements in the array.
    - Subtract this sum from the expected sum of 1 to n, and adjust with the repeated number to get the missing one.

    Time Complexity:
        - Sorting takes O(n log n), traversal takes O(n)
        - Total Time Complexity: O(n log n)

    Space Complexity:
        - Sorting is done in-place; only a few scalar variables are used: O(1)

-----------------------------------
Approach 2: Using HashMap
-----------------------------------
    - Use a HashMap to store frequencies of each number as you traverse the array.
    - When a frequency > 1 is encountered, that number is the repeated one.
    - Also calculate the sum of all elements.
    - Compute the missing number using the formula:
        missing = (expected sum - actual sum) + repeated

    Time Complexity:
        - One pass through the array: O(n)
        - HashMap operations are O(1) on average
        - Total Time Complexity: O(n)

    Space Complexity:
        - Uses extra space for HashMap: O(n)

-----------------------------------
Approach 3: Mathematical Approach
-----------------------------------
    - Let x be the repeated number and y be the missing number.
    - Calculate actual sum and actual square sum of array elements.
    - Use the known formulas:
        - Expected sum: S = n(n+1)/2
        - Expected square sum: S2 = n(n+1)(2n+1)/6
        - x - y = actualSum - S
        - x² - y² = actualSquaredSum - S2

    - From above, derive:
        - x + y = (x² - y²) / (x - y)
        - Solve for x and y using linear equations.

    Time Complexity:
        - Single pass through the array: O(n)
        - Total Time Complexity: O(n)

    Space Complexity:
        - Only scalar variables used: O(1)
