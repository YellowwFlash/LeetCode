âœ… Given Question:
You're given a list of numbers that are already sorted, and a target number.
Your task is to find two values from that list:
    - The **floor**: the biggest number in the list that is still less than or equal to the target.
    - The **ceil**: the smallest number in the list that is still greater than or equal to the target.

âœ… Given Data:
You have:
    - An array of numbers (already sorted from smallest to largest).
    - A target number to compare against.
You are guaranteed that:
    - There's at least one number in the list that is smaller than or equal to the target (floor exists).
    - There's at least one number in the list that is greater than or equal to the target (ceil exists).

âœ… Intuition:
Since the list is already sorted, we donâ€™t need to check every single number one by one.
Instead, we can focus our search:
    - If the middle number is too small or too big, we can ignore half the list.
    - This makes the process much faster, especially when the list is long.

Now, letâ€™s look at how to find both values by carefully narrowing down our options.

Approach-1: Finding Floor and Ceil by Narrowing Down
------------------------------------------------------------

ðŸ”¹ Finding the Floor (the biggest number thatâ€™s just â‰¤ target):

    - Start by looking at the whole list.
    - Pick the number in the middle.
        - If that number is less than or equal to the target:
            - It could be the answer, but maybe thereâ€™s a bigger one further to the right.
            - So, remember this number as a possible answer, and move to the right half of the list.
        - If the number is bigger than the target:
            - Itâ€™s too high to be the floor, so we move to the left side to find a smaller one.
    - Keep doing this until youâ€™ve checked all the possibilities.
    - By the end, the last remembered number will be the floor.

ðŸ”¹ Finding the Ceil (the smallest number thatâ€™s just â‰¥ target):

    - Again, look at the whole list.
    - Check the number in the middle.
        - If that number is greater than or equal to the target:
            - It could be the answer, but maybe thereâ€™s a smaller one further to the left.
            - So, remember this number and move to the left half of the list.
        - If the number is smaller than the target:
            - Itâ€™s too low to be the ceil, so we move to the right half.
    - After checking all options, the last remembered number will be the ceil.

    This method works because the list is sorted, so we always know which direction to search based on whether the current number is too big or too small.

    Time Complexity:
        - O(log n) for each of floor and ceil search â†’ Total: O(log n)

    Space Complexity:
        - O(1), constant space used
