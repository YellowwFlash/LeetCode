âœ… Given Question:
Generate all possible subsets (also known as the power set) of a given array of integers.

âœ… Given Data:
An integer array `nums` of size `n`.
You are required to return a list containing all possible subsets (including the empty set and the full array).
Each subset must maintain the relative order of elements from the original array.

âœ… Intuition:
This problem follows the standard **backtracking** pattern where, for each index,
we explore two possibilities:
    - Include the current element in the current subset.
    - Exclude the current element and move to the next.

By recursively applying both choices at every step, we cover all `2^n` possible subsets.

This is essentially the same approach used in generating subsequences â€” since subsets
are also just subsequences with no requirement of being contiguous.

----------------------------------------------
Approach: Recursive Backtracking (Include/Exclude Method)
----------------------------------------------
1. Base Case:
    - If the current index reaches the end of the array (`n`), weâ€™ve formed a complete subset.
    - Add a copy of the current subset to the result list.

2. Recursive Step:
    - Include `nums[index]` in the current subset.
        - Recurse with index + 1.
    - Backtrack by removing the last added element.
    - Exclude `nums[index]` and recurse with index + 1.

âœ… Example:
For input nums = [1, 2], the subsets will be:
    - [], [2], [1], [1, 2]

âœ… Time Complexity:
    - O(2^n): Each element has two options â†’ total combinations = 2^n.
    - O(n) time to copy each subset to the result list.

âœ… Space Complexity:
    - O(n): Recursion stack and current subset list.
    - O(2^n * n): For storing all subsets in the final result.

------------------------------------------------------
Approach-2: Bit Manipulation
------------------------------------------------------
ðŸ”¹ Method: `findSubsequencesBit(int[] nums)`
This method uses bit masking to represent inclusion/exclusion of elements.

1. Each subset corresponds to a binary number from `0` to `2^n - 1`.
    - Each bit in the number represents whether to include `nums[j]` or not.

2. For each number `i` from 0 to `2^n - 1`:
    - Use a loop to inspect each bit from LSB to MSB.
    - If the bit is `1`, include `nums[j]` in the current subset.

3. Add each generated subset to the result list.

âœ… Example:
For nums = [1, 2], total = 2^2 = 4
    - i = 0 â†’ 00 â†’ []
    - i = 1 â†’ 01 â†’ [1]
    - i = 2 â†’ 10 â†’ [2]
    - i = 3 â†’ 11 â†’ [1, 2]

âœ… Time Complexity:
    - O(2^n * n): Looping through 2^n combinations, each requiring up to n operations.

âœ… Space Complexity:
    - O(2^n * n): For storing all subsets.
